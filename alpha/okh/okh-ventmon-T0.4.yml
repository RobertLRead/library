title: VentMon v0.4T
description: The VentMon is basically a cloud-enable spirometer with an FiO2 sensor. It can
  simply be plugged into a standard 22mm airway and provides a rich stream of
  pressure, flow, and Oxygen sensor, with humidity and temperature sensing as
  well. The primary use of the VentMon is by engineering teams developing
  pandemic response ventilators and other respiration tools. Secondarily, it is
  completely and transparently open source, so any team can adopt the design and
  incorporate it into their own devices to provide the same data in an
  integrated way.
intended-use: The original purpose of the VentMon was to support pandemic response teams
  creating emergency ventilators. Interposed between a ventilator under test and
  a plastic test lung, it provides a display similar to the clinical display on
  modern ventilators, allow engineers to validate all mechanical function of the
  ventilators. Additionally, it compute rise time as a performance metric. It
  produces data in the PIRDS standard, which can be logged and is later
  processed by the VentDisplay software.
